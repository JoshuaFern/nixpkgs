    longDescription = ''
      Fltrdr, or flat-reader, is an interactive text reader for the terminal. It
      is flat in the sense that the reader is word-based. It creates a
      horizontal stream of words, ignoring all newline characters and reducing
      extra whitespace. Its purpose is to facilitate reading, scanning, and
      searching text. The program has a play mode that moves the reader forward
      one word at a time, along with a configurable words per minute (WPM),
      setting.
